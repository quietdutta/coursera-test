<h1>about.</h1>
<p>a website for hosting notes for es@tuhh auf englisch. 
    below are the notes taken in markdown which I plan to upload after every lecture. 
    included are also the official documents from stud.ip, but maybe altered depending on the course. 
    </p>
    <p>none of this is official.</p>
